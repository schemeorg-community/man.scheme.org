# man.scheme.org

This repository contains the scripts that generate the
[`man.scheme.org`](https://man.scheme.org/) website.

The manual pages on the website are sourced from:

1. The [`scheme-manpages`](https://github.com/schemedoc/manpages)
   project.

2. Scheme implementations' source releases.

Other sources can be added if they exist.

The roff markup is converted into HTML using
[unroff](https://conservatory.scheme.org/unroff/).
